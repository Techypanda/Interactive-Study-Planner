Indigenous Cultures and Health Behaviours
In this unit students will examine culture and diversity within local, national and global Indigenous populations; impacts of specific policies and historical events on Indigenous Australians and the effects of these policies on health, illness and disability, and health care access. Applying theories of health behaviour students will analyse health outcomes of Indigenous Australians and explore underlying social, environmental, psychological and biological determinants. Within a primary health care model, students will explore how health professionals can work inter-professionally and in partnership with Indigenous individuals, families, communities and organisations.

Foundations of Biostatistics and Epidemiology
Foundations of Biostatistics and Epidemiology enables students to learn core skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. Students critically appraise public health and clinical epidemiological research literature and perform basic statistical analysis. Students will encounter basic statistical and graphical description and analysis of epidemiological and biomedical data with appropriate graphs, tables, and summary measures; statistical inference and statistical hypothesis testing applied to problems in health and clinical medicine using parametric and non-parametric tests; calculation of common epidemiological measures of disease frequency and association such as incidence rate, prevalence, attributable risk, risk ratios and odds ratio; role and significance of inferential statistics such as confidence intervals and probability values. Various epidemiological research designs and their strengths and limitations as well as threats to the internal validity; role of chance, bias and confounding are included.

Physiological Processes
Physiology is the study of the functions of an organism. This unit examines several fundamental body functions, e.g., absorption, secretion, communication, transport and movement, from a physiological perspective. These themes are addressed within five modules: cellular physiology; nerve & muscle physiology; cellular communication; endocrine physiology and energy metabolism.

Human Evolution
From theories of early Homo origins, to the evolution and origins of modern humans, with particular interest in aboriginal origins (first peoples), this unit explores theories of human evolution, prehistory, primate characteristics and fossil records. Laboratory work relates to the methodology of physical anthropology, comparative anatomy, the analysis of bone, teeth and stone tools. Methods of phylogenetic analysis, including Numerical Taxonomy and Cladistics using computer software are utilised in this unit. Students will develop competence in extracting maximum information from minimal traces, and developing a critical approach to making inferences. Paleontological perspectives are covered.
