These fundamentals are then applied to new venture creation through first hand interaction with innovative entrepreneurs developing new innovations and technologies from the business community as well as university developed inventions with intent to commercialise their Intellectual Property. This allows the real world of the innovative entrepreneur to reinforce and sometimes challenge accepted theories of innovation and entrepreneurship.
