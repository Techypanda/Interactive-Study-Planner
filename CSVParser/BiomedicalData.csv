UNIT
MEDI1000
Foundations of Biomedical Science
This unit is an introduction to the theory and application of disciplines in the biomedical sciences: microbiology, immunology, histopathology, haematology, biochemistry and molecular genetics. Themes include the basic theory of the cellular and molecular components that form the foundations of biomedical science, the investigation of disease and infectious agents, occupational health considerations, the use of specialized equipment and testing of biological samples in a professional manner. The role and function of medical and research laboratories will also be explored.

Indigenous Cultures and Health Behaviours
In this unit students will examine culture and diversity within local, national and global Indigenous populations; impacts of specific policies and historical events on Indigenous Australians and the effects of these policies on health, illness and disability, and health care access. Applying theories of health behaviour students will analyse health outcomes of Indigenous Australians and explore underlying social, environmental, psychological and biological determinants. Within a primary health care model, students will explore how health professionals can work inter-professionally and in partnership with Indigenous individuals, families, communities and organisations.

EPID1000
Foundations of Biostatistics and Epidemiology
Foundations of Biostatistics and Epidemiology enables students to learn core skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. Students critically appraise public health and clinical epidemiological research literature and perform basic statistical analysis. Students will encounter basic statistical and graphical description and analysis of epidemiological and biomedical data with appropriate graphs, tables, and summary measures; statistical inference and statistical hypothesis testing applied to problems in health and clinical medicine using parametric and non-parametric tests; calculation of common epidemiological measures of disease frequency and association such as incidence rate, prevalence, attributable risk, risk ratios and odds ratio; role and significance of inferential statistics such as confidence intervals and probability values. Various epidemiological research designs and their strengths and limitations as well as threats to the internal validity; role of chance, bias and confounding are included.

UNIT
HUMB1001
Integrated Systems Anatomy and Physiology
An integrated approach to the study of body systems correlating structure and function of the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, urinary and reproductive systems together with their endocrine and neural control. Students will investigate the interaction of these systems in normal body functioning and in selected altered body states.

UNIT
GENE1000
Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology
In this unit, students will explore the fundamental concepts of molecular and cell biology, including the central dogma, traditional Mendelian, and modern molecular genetics. Topics will include DNA structure and replication; regulation of gene transcription; protein synthesis and post-translational modification. Cell structure and function will also be explored. The laboratory component allows students to acquire skills to perform experiments in molecular and cell biology. This unit provides the background knowledge necessary for entry into second year units.

Vital Physiology
Physiology is the study of the functions of an organism. This unit looks at the physiological underpinning of the supply and removal of oxygen, water and waste products to and from tissues, and the mechanisms that regulate these within homeostatic limits.
