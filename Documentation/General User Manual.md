## Introduction

This document is a user manual relating to the use of the General Frontend of the Curtin Medical Study Planner. The General Frontend has two main methods of use, the bottom up and the top down approaches, which allow the user to approach their study plan creation in a different way. The General Frontend also has a secondary functionality that allows users to view the more detailed information on a selected unit from the list of all possible units.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## How to Use the Study Planner

The General Frontend starts on the landing page which consists of three navigation cards. The three cards respectively navigate to the study planner, the view all careers and the view all units page. The landing page is shown in the image below.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

After selecting the Plan My Medical Course navigation card, the user will see two navigation cards (see image below) representing the two approaches, bottom up and top down, that the user can take in creating their study plan.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Bottom Up

The bottom up approach is the more traditional method where the user selects majors, specializations and/or units to create a study plan which is also used to match the user with possible careers that their study plan may lead them to.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

After selecting the bottom up navigation card, the user will be presented with several majors (as shown above). The section on the right shows current careers that would be compatible with their study plan and when a career is clicked will navigate to an information page on the career. The section on the left will show their current selected majors, specializations and/or units in their study plan.

The user will need to select one major to begin and the selected major will partially populate the user&#39;s study plan as shown by the the list on the left hand side in the image below. After selecting a major, the user will be on the main study planner page, where the user may select other majors, specializations and/or units to complete their study plan.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

![Planner Selection Page](./imgs/General/BottomUpSelection.PNG)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

To switch between viewing majors, specializations and units, the drop down box located in the top left is used. When completing the study plan, the user may select majors, specializations and/or units up to a maximum number. For example, a user may select two majors or have one major and two specializations, the accepted study plan types are listed on the right next to the available careers section.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

When selecting majors, specializations and/or units, some of these may have incompatibilities, pre or co requisites and/or already be in the user study plan. In such a case, an error popup will occur indicating the reason for the error as shown in the image below.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Top Down

The top down approach has the user choose one career from a list of careers which is then used to prepopulate their study plan with units. From here the user can then fill in the rest of their study plan with other majors, specializations and/or units.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

![Intial Page of Top Down Approach](./imgs/General/TopDownInitial.PNG)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

After clicking the top down navigation card, the user will be directed to a page displaying a list of careers as shown above. The user may select a career which will allow them to see more information about it or navigate back to the list of careers. After deciding on their chosen career, the user can proceed to the next step where the system will pre-populate their study plan with the career&#39;s suggested units and then allow them to choose other majors, specializations and/or units as needed to complete the study plan.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## ViewAll Careers

The view all careers page shows a list of all careers which when selected lead to an information page displaying the detailed information of the selected career. The list page also has a search bar to filter the careers.
