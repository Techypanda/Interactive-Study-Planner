In this major, students will learn how drugs target specific receptors in tissues and explore the major biochemical pathways that are activated. Other topics include dose-response relationship, toxicity, drug metabolism and elimination, drug design and development, and how genetic variation between populations influences drug response. With the increased global challenge to develop new drugs against infectious agents, an emphasis is placed on the understanding of drug action against microorganisms.
