<h1>How to run</h1>
<p>
The following code, more specifically, the react component listed in Components folder can be used to display the corresponding unit information.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at App.js to look at how you'd pass in the prop. Essentially all you need to do is to figure out a way to pass in the unit code string from the table selected to pass it to the prop, and call it as unitCode="..."
</p>

And thats it.
